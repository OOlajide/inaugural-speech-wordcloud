This is a historic day for our nation, for it marks an important milestone
in our march towards a maturing democracy. For the first time since we
cast off the shackles of colonialism almost a half-century ago, we have
at last managed an orderly transition from one elected government to
another.
We acknowledge that our elections had some shortcomings. Thankfully,
we have well-established legal avenues of redress, and I urge anyone
aggrieved to pursue them. I also believe that our experiences represent
an opportunity to learn from our mistakes. Accordingly, I will set up a
panel to examine the entire electoral process with a view to ensuring
that we raise the quality and standard of our general elections, and
thereby deepen our democracy.
This occasion is historic also because it marks another kind of
transitional generational shift when the children of independence
assume the adult responsibility of running the country at the heart of
Africa.
My fellow citizens, I am humbled and honoured that you have elected
me and Vice President Jonathan to represent that generation in the
task of building a just and humane nation, where its people have a fair
chance to attain their fullest potential.
Luckily we are not starting from scratch. We are fortunate to have been
led the past eight years by one of our nation's greatest patriots,
President Obasanjo. On behalf of all our people, I salute you, Mr.
President, for your vision, your courage and your boundless energy in 
creating the roadmap toward that united and economically thriving
Nigeria that we seek.
Many of us may find it hard to believe now, but before you assumed
the presidency eight years ago, the national conversation was about
whether Nigeria deserved to remain one country at all. Today we are
talking about Nigeria's potential, to become one of the 20 largest
economies in the world by the year 2020. That is a measure of how far
we have come. And we thank you.
The administration of President Obasanjo has laid the foundation upon
which we can build our future prosperity. Over the past eight years
Nigerians have reached a national consensus in at least four areas: to
deepen democracy and the rule of law; build an economy driven
primarily by the private sector, not government; display zero tolerance
for corruption in all its forms, and, finally, restructure and staff our
government to ensure efficiency and good governance. I commit myself
to these tasks.
Our goal now is to build on the greatest accomplishments of the past
few years. Relying on the 7-point agenda that formed the basis of our
compact with voters during the recent campaigns, we will concentrate
on rebuilding our physical infrastructure and human capital in order to
take our country forward. We will focus on accelerating economic and
other reforms in a way that makes a concrete and visible difference to
ordinary people.
Our economy already has been set on the path of growth. Now we
must continue to do the necessary work to create more jobs, lower
interest rates, reduce inflation, and maintain a stable exchange rate. All
this will increase our chances for rapid growth and development.
Central to this is rebuilding our basic infrastructure. We already have
comprehensive plans for mass transportation, especially railroad
development. We will make these plans a reality.
Equally important, we must devote our best efforts to overcoming the
energy challenge. Over the next four years we will see dramatic
improvements in power generation, transmission and distribution.
These plans will mean little if we do not respect the rule of law.
Our government is determined to strengthen the capacity of law
enforcement agencies, especially the police. The state must fulfill its
constitutional responsibility of protecting life and property.
The crisis in the Niger Delta commands our urgent attention. Ending it
is a matter of strategic importance to our country. I will use every
resource available to me, with your help, to address this crisis in a spirit
of fairness, justice, and cooperation.
We have a good starting point because our predecessor already
launched a master plan that can serve as a basis for a comprehensive
examination of all the issues. We will involve all stakeholders in working
out a solution.
As part of this effort, we will move quickly to ensure security of life and
property, and to make investments safe. In the meantime, I appeal to
all aggrieved communities, groups and individuals to immediately
suspend all violent activities, and respect the law. Let us allow the
impending dialogue to take place in a conducive atmosphere. We are
all in this together,
and we will find a way to achieve peace and justice.
As we work to resolve the challenges of the Niger Delta, so must we
also tackle poverty throughout the country. By fighting poverty, we
fight disease. We will make advances in public health, to control the
scourge of HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases that hold back our
population and limit our progress.
We are determined to intensify the war against corruption, more so
because corruption is itself central to the spread of poverty. Its
corrosive effect is all too visible in all aspects of our national life. This is
an area where we have made significant progress in recent years, and
we will maintain the momentum.
We also are committed to rebuilding our human capital, if we are to
support a modern economy. We must revive education in order to
create more equality, and citizens who can function more productively
in today's world.
To our larger African family, you have our commitment to the goal of
African integration. We will continue to collaborate with fellow African
states to reduce conflict and free our people from the leg chains of
poverty. To all our friends in the international community, we pledge
our continuing fidelity to the goals of progress in Africa and peace in
the world.
Fellow citizens, I ask you all to march with me into the age of
restoration. Let us work together to restore our time-honoured values
of honesty, decency, generosity, modesty, selflessness, transparency,
and accountability. These fundamental values determine societies that
succeed or fail. We must choose to succeed.
I will set a worthy personal example as your president.
No matter what obstacles confront us, I have confidence and faith in
our ability to overcome them. After all, we are Nigerians! We are a
resourceful and enterprising people, and we have it within us to make
our country a better place. To that end I offer myself as a servantleader. I will be a listener and doer, and serve with humility.
To fulfill our ambitions, all our leaders at all levels whether a local
government councilor or state governor, senator or cabinet minister 
must change our style and our attitude. We must act at all times with
humility, courage, and forthrightness. I ask you, fellow citizens, to join
me in rebuilding our Nigerian family, one that defines the success of
one by the happiness of many.
I ask you to set aside negative attitudes, and concentrate all our
energies on getting to our common destination. All hands must be on
deck.
Let us join together to ease the pains of today while working for the
gains of tomorrow. Let us set aside cynicism and strive for the good
society that we know is within our reach. Let us discard the habit of low
expectations of ourselves as well as of our leaders.
Let us stop justifying every shortcoming with that unacceptable phrase
â€˜the Nigerian Factor' as if to be a Nigerian is to settle for less. Let us
recapture the mood of optimism that defined us at the dawn of
independence, that legendary cando spirit that marked our Nigerianess.
Let us join together, now, to build a society worthy of our children. We
have the talent. We have the intelligence. We have the ability.
The challenge is great. The goal is clear. The time is now.
